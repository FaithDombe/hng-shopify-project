## Mandatory checks

- [ ] **Atomic:** exactly one ticket, max ~1 day of work (≤400 lines). Larger needs a `size-override` label from a reviewer.
- [ ] **Feature flag:** new routes and large features sit behind a `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_*` flag, default `OFF`.
  - Flag name: `____________` (write `N/A` for small UI tweaks)
- [ ] **Database / API contract:** schema changes follow Expand-Contract — no destructive drops or renames.
- [ ] **Preview:** I verified the change in the fork build (and my team's preview link, if we deploy one).
- [ ] **Protected files:** I did not change `.github/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` or tooling config without reviewer agreement and the `config-change-approved` label.

## Screenshots / recording

<!-- Required for visible or interactive changes. Otherwise write "N/A, non-visual change". -->
